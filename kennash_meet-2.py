# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# if 3 > 1:
#     print("True")

# a = "Hello"
# print(a) #This is why we can't tell python to print out a string without quote marks
# print( ) #This line prints out an empty output line

# a = 2
# print(a) #You can reassign variables on the fly, and this is very important
# print( )

# a = a + 1
# print(a)
# print( )
